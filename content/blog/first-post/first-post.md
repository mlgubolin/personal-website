Hi there, hello! I'm Maria Lucia Gubolin, and welcome to my blog, which will focus primarily on Machine Learning and Data Science. Among other things. 

I come from an unconventional background in the tech world. My M.Sc. is in Astrophysics, yet my industry career has largely been centered around software development. Now, after several years, I'm pivoting back to the realm of data science. Let me walk you through my journey.

In my Master's program, the bulk of my work involved data scienceâ€”creating plots, analyzing data, using Python extensively and running Hydrodynamic Simulations of Black Holes. To be quite honest, after working with it for a while, I realized that was not what I wanted to do. As a contrast, during my undergraduate years, I coded primarily in C, focusing on high-performance computing related to physics. Unlike then, my Master's work didn't involve "coding" in the way I loved; it was more about running pre-existing simulations and scripts. This led me to switch gears and explore the world of real world software development by learning Ruby and, while in my first job, also Go.

After stepping away from data science in 2017, I've noticed substantial changes in the field. Advances in tools and frameworks stepped up the game all around. Although I still have some reservations about the discipline, especially concerning software development practices, I'll share those insights in upcoming posts.

So, here I am, making a return to data science, armed with the experience I've gathered over the last five years. I'm excited to share my journey and insights with you all.

Stay tuned for more!
